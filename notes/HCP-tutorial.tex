\subsection{Concepts}
A connectome is a comprehensive diagram of all neurons and synaptic connections contained within a nervous system.

\subsection{About the project}
This project aims to elucidate the neural pathways that underlie human brain function and behavior, which could shed light into the unique properties of human brains.
\\
Four imaging modalities are used to acquire data:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item functional MRI, diffusion MRI
  \item Task-evoked fMRI
  \item Structural MRI
  \item Behavioral data
\end{enumerate}

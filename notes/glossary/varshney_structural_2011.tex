  name=Cluster Coefficient,
  description={ measures the density of connections among an average neuron's neighbors. \cite{varshney_structural_2011}.
	$$ C = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i} C_i $$
	$$ C_i = \frac{2E(\mathcal{N}_i)}{k_i(k_i - 1)} $$
	where $ E(\mathcal{N}_i) $ is the number of connections between neighbors of $i$, $k_i$ is the number of neighbors of $i$, and $C_i$ measures the density of
connections in the neighborhood of neuron i (set $ C_i = 1 $ when $ k_i = 1 $).

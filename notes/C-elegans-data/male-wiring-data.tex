\section{Male C-elegans Wiring Data}
\label{section:male wiring}

Male C. elegans has 81 neurons in addition to hermaphrodite C. Elegans.
\cite{jarrell_connectome_2012}

\paragraph{More info: }
The six most central neurons are: AVAL, AVBR, RIGL, AVBL, RIBL and AVKL

Single combined network by adding the adjacency matrix of the gap junction and chemical networks together:
\begin{quote}
New net work consisting 279 neurons and 2990 directed connections. It has one large strongly connected component of 274 neurons and 5 strongly isolated neurons. The 5
isolated neurons are IL2DL/R, PLNR, DD06, PVDR.
Mean path length $ L = 2.87 $.
